# clodictearch 

Search algorithm meant for searching closest words based on Levenshtein distance

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/danorel/clodictearch
```

## Usage

1. To try a search algorithm for a small manually created dictionary of words, use:

```
lein run train-dict hello
```

2. To try a search algorithm for a large English dictionary of words, use:

```
lein run train-dict hello
```

3. To run tests which cover levenshtein distance evaluation and search algorithm based on Levenshtein index, use:

```
lein test
```
